# Introduction to Scientific Python

The main objective of the course is to make users familiar with the Python programming language.     
The course is mostly targeted to users without a strong previous experience with Python, but with some notions of programming (MATLAB, Octave, ...). The different applications presented are oriented to Oceanography in general.

## Content

The content can be divided into 4 parts:
1. General description of the language.
2. Reading/writing information from/to files.
3. Data processing and analysis.
4. Data visualisation.

The material is organised into sub-folders:
- in [notebooks](./notebooks/) you find the `jupyter-notebook` describing the different programs.
- [exercises](./exercises/) contains some exercises that will be explained and solved during the course.

## How to start?

During the course, participants will use virtual machines (VM) on which all the necessary tools are installed, in order to avoid the sometimes tedious installation steps, often depending on the operating system.
